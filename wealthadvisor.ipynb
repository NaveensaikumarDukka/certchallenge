QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

Furthermore, a portfolio’s longevity may be lengthened by a year or two by withdrawing funds from tax-deferred accounts up to the top of a “low” tax bracket and withdrawing additional funds from tax-exempt accounts. Combining the two strategies suggests that retirees may add several years to a portfolio by withdrawing funds in a tax-smart manner. The Role of Social Government Retirement Insurance. Many jurisdictions have a social safety net that provides retirement income for its citizens. Frequently called “social security,” it often represents a significant source of income, especially for non-high-net-worth investors. Jennings and Reichenstein (2001a) emphasize that the present value of these benefits may be large enough to influence even high-net-worth investors’ portfolios. Although programs vary widely from one jurisdiction to the next, a common element is the provision of lifetime income that mitigates longevity risk. For many investors, this social government retirement insurance is an important risk management tool. Often, beneficiaries are given a choice of when to begin receiving benefits, with the promise of higher benefits if they choose to delay initiation. Several studies have determined which starting date maximizes the present value of benefits in a U.S. setting. Sun and Webb (2009) and Meyer and Reichenstein (2010) also determine which date or dates minimize longevity risk. For single taxpayers who will live an average lifetime and who will not be subject to an earnings test, the present value of benefits is approximately the same no matter when benefits begin. Therefore, based on the present value criterion, singles with short life expectancies should begin benefits early and vice versa. To minimize longevity risk, singles should delay benefits to age 70. The decisions for couples revolve around spousal and survivors benefits. The consensus opinion appears to be that the higher earner should delay the start of benefits based on his or her earnings record until age 70, whereas the lower earner should probably begin benefits early. Munnell and Soto (2005) consider only the present value criterion and conclude that if the lower earner’s primary insurance amount (PIA) is at least 40 percent of the higher earner’s, the present value of benefits is maximized when the lower earner begins benefits at age 62 and the higher earner begins at 69. Sun and Webb (2009) and Meyer and Reichenstein (2010) consider both criteria and conclude that the higher earner should delay the start of benefits based on his or her earnings record until age 70; a key insight is that this delay will maximize the surviving spouse’s benefits. Meyer and Reichenstein (2010) note that the higher earner should begin spousal benefits when he or she attains full retirement age and then switch to benefits based on his or her earnings record at 70. There is less consensus on whether the lower earner should begin benefits early or nearer full retirement age, but it also appears to be a less important issue.'], response=None, multi_responses=None, reference='Private wealth managers can enhance portfolio longevity for high-net-worth clients by applying after-tax portfolio optimization and tax-efficient withdrawal strategies. According to Brunel (1999b), taxable investors should favor alternative assets more than tax-exempt investors, especially those with average to above-average risk profiles, as part of after-tax portfolio optimization. These alternatives, despite challenges such as illiquidity and tax inefficiency in some cases, offer diversification benefits and opportunities for tax-loss harvesting. Additionally, retirees can extend their portfolio’s longevity by two to five years by spending funds from taxable accounts before tapping into retirement accounts. Further longevity gains of one to two years may be achieved by withdrawing funds from tax-deferred accounts up to the top of a low tax bracket and then withdrawing additional funds from tax-exempt accounts. Combining these withdrawal sequencing strategies allows retirees to add several years to their portfolio life.

See Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley (2009) on alpha–beta separation, Jeffrey and Arnott (1993) on alphas needing to pay their own taxes, and Chance (2007) on the tax inefficiency of derivatives-based strategies. Rebalancing. The tax cost of rebalancing is another topic of significance to private wealth managers. Although rebalancing helps control risk, the private wealth manager must compare the costs and benefits of rebalancing. In general, the optimal solution is often to balance part-way back to the strategic asset mix. Leland (1999), Donohue and Yip (2003), and Masters (2003) provide important generalist works on rebalancing. A number of factors influence rebalancing ranges for particular asset classes: • the risk of the asset class, • the risk of the remainder of the portfolio, • the risk tolerance of the investor, • the correlation of the asset class with the remainder of the portfolio, and • transaction costs. Private wealth managers considering these factors should note particularly the inclusion of transaction costs. Taxes are a form of transaction cost—and are likely much larger than explicit transaction costs. Heavy tax transaction costs can substantially widen the no-trade region where rebalancing should not occur. The fact that taxes are paid on gains and at least partially recaptured on losses can produce asymmetries in rebalancing ranges. (Taxes increase transaction costs when an asset has appreciated but lower transaction costs through realizing capital losses when an asset has depreciated. Accordingly, rebalancing ranges will be wider for gains and tighter for losses.) Under this interpretation, the same asset held in a taxable account and a tax-advantaged account is treated differently in rebalancing. Rebalancing the asset held in the tax-advantaged account does not have tax-related transaction costs. Accordingly, a single asset, such as stocks, has two different rebalance ranges. If portfolios are sufficiently out of balance to merit trading, what should private wealth managers do? Donohue and Yip (2003) recommend rebalancing back to range edges. For example, if the relevant range is 55–65 percent stocks and the 65 percent limit is surpassed, go back to 65 percent stocks. In contrast, Masters (2003) recommends rebalancing half-way back from the range edge to the target allocation, 62.5 percent from the preceding example. This conclusion arises from his cost-versus-benefit approach to rebalancing. Whichever approach one finds more persuasive, the private wealth manager needs to incorporate taxes as a transaction cost into his or her thinking—likely widening the ranges over tax-exempt investors and producing an asymmetry. Horvitz (2002) provides a no-equations consideration of rebalancing in private wealth management. He takes the view that practical impediments and operational realities are generally given short shrift in the mathematical rebalancing literature. He gives particular consideration to the problems of rebalancing illiquid assets, such as private equity or real estate, and concludes “there may be little point in rebalancing only those portions of a portfolio that are liquid” (p. 49). Saving and Spending Strategies All finance professionals are aware of the importance of systematic saving to build wealth. Whether in the context of retirement planning or creating wealth through a family business, life-cycle investing is principally divided into accumulation and distribution phases. This section focuses on ideas that, although typically developed in either the mass affluent or high-net-worth investor setting, have applications to most all high-net-worth investors.', '<2-hop>\\n\\nSavings and Wealth Accumulation. Ibbotson, Xiong, Kreitler, Kreitler, and Chen (2007) develop guidelines for savings rates for a variety of individual circumstances. For various income levels and ages, they show the annual savings rate required to replace 80 percent of income. This savings rate is adjusted downward based on the amount of current savings. Because they include Social Security and focus on retirement income replacement, they show that high-income individuals need much higher savings rates than low-income individuals. Similarly, Leibowitz, Durham, Hammond, and Heller (2002) port the institutional concept of the pension funding ratio to come up with guidance on appropriate asset-to-salary ratios for different income replacement levels, time until retirement, expected returns, and savings rates.'], response=None, multi_responses=None, reference='Private wealth managers incorporate tax considerations into rebalancing strategies by treating taxes as a significant form of transaction cost, often larger than explicit transaction costs. This tax impact widens the no-trade region where rebalancing should not occur, creating asymmetries in rebalancing ranges: wider ranges for assets that have appreciated (due to higher tax costs) and tighter ranges for depreciated assets (due to potential capital loss realization). Consequently, the same asset held in taxable and tax-advantaged accounts is managed differently, with tax-advantaged accounts having no tax-related transaction costs and thus narrower rebalancing ranges. Managers may choose to rebalance either back to the range edge or halfway to the target allocation, balancing cost versus benefit. These tax-aware rebalancing strategies help control risk while optimizing after-tax returns, which is crucial for savings and wealth accumulation, especially for high-net-worth clients who require tailored savings rates and asset-to-salary ratios to meet their income replacement goals.', rubrics=None), synthesizer_name='multi_hop_abstract_query_synthesizer'), TestsetSample(eval_sample=SingleTurnSample(user_input='how private wealth managers use the concept of longevity risk and conservative investment posture from extended portfolio including liabilities and assets to guide rebalancing decisions in portfolio implementation?', retrieved_contexts=None, reference_contexts=['<1-hop>\\n\\nPrivate Wealth Management ©2010 The Research Foundation of CFA Institute 11 Similarly, Black, Ciccotello, and Skipper (2002) advocate for “comprehensive personal financial planning,” including a wide range of off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities; their approach is broader than the retirement focus of Reichenstein (1998) and Reichenstein and Jennings (2003) and broader than the expanded-asset view of Chen, Ibbotson, Milevsky, and Zhu (2006). Black, Ciccotello, and Skipper’s view of the family portfolio includes such assets as “government benefits, insurance, expected inheritances or other family support, and human capital” (p. 3). In addition, they include such liabilities as mortgages and future expenditures “including but not limited to tax, housing, education, and health care” (p. 3). Theirs is one of the broadest definitions of the extended portfolio in the literature. Wilcox, Horvitz, and diBartolomeo (2006) encourage private wealth managers to form a time series of implied balance sheets for each client. Assets and liabilities are assets and liabilities, both implied and actual. For example, the present value of future savings from employment is an implied employment asset, whereas the present value of spending in retirement is an implied liability. The ratio of discretionary wealth to total assets, where discretionary wealth is total assets less total liabilities, determines the client’s appropriate level of investment aggressiveness. Clients with large relative discretionary wealth can invest aggressively, whereas clients with no or little discretionary wealth to total assets should invest conservatively. Wilcox (2008) extends the analysis to incorporate the uncertain nature of investment goals resulting largely from longevity risk and shows that this uncertainty suggests a more conservative investment posture. Modern financial engineering offers the potential to better address client needs than traditional approaches have. Bodie (2003) contrasts life-cycle investing with single-period Markowitz optimization and describes how advances in financial engineering as well as developments in individual investor psychology can be used to help investors reach their goals. Like Bodie, Merton (2003) offers insights on life-cycle investing and sophisticated financial products. For individual investors, Merton advocates considering the risk of human capital, the risk of future reinvestments, volatility of spending versus volatility of wealth, the importance of targeted expenditures (i.e., liabilities), and “condo value insurance” (which hedges against residential real estate declining in value). Warshawsky (2007) discusses how investors can efficiently hedge risks associated with longevity and long-term health care by bundling a life annuity and long-term care insurance. His work is part of a larger body of readings on life-cycle investing edited by Bodie, McLeavey, and Siegel (2007) and another subsequent set of readings focused on retirement by Bodie, Siegel, and Sullivan (2009). Institutional pension management has long incorporated the idea of asset/liability management (ALM) or liability-driven investing (LDI). It is a truism that investors without liabilities do not need to invest; the point of the asset portfolio is to defer consumption to pay for future liabilities. Amenc, Martellini, Milhau, and Ziemann (2009) attempt to more practically operationalize the insights of institutional ALM and LDI in the private wealth management context. They emphasize that liability awareness requires consideration of the properties of assets that hedge those liabilities. For many individual investors, these liabilities include inflation-sensitive future consumption and the future purchase of real estate. Although not labeled as such, a type of ALM applied to taxable private clients is seen in the work of Wilcox, Horvitz, and diBartolomeo (2006). The case for thinking about the extended portfolio of assets and liabilities is compelling. Private wealth managers can add value for clients by incorporating these ideas into portfolio management. The uniqueness of each investor’s “off-balance-sheet” assets means wealth managers can add value by customizing the financial portfolio.', '<2-hop>\\n\\nPortfolio Implementation After the strategic asset mix is decided, the work of the private wealth manager is not complete. The operational realities of private wealth management differ from those of institutional investment management. In the following, we consider two aspects of portfolio implementation—manager structure and rebalancing—where private wealth management has a distinctive approach.', '<3-hop>\\n\\nImplementation Other Issues • Asset mix • Style structure • Inheritance • Subportfolios • Rebalancing • Philanthropy • Tax adjustments • Low-basis stock • Behavioral finance • Extended portfolio • Asset location • Legal concerns • Asset/liability management • Tax • Ethics • Saving and decumulation'], response=None, multi_responses=None, reference='Private wealth managers incorporate longevity risk and a conservative investment posture by considering an extended portfolio that includes both on- and off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities, such as government benefits, insurance, expected inheritances, mortgages, and future expenditures like tax, housing, education, and health care.

Luck (2003) and Horvitz and Wilcox (2003) also demonstrate the value of active tax management, such as loss harvesting. In short, taxes matter. Less well understood is that taxes also affect investment risk. To put it simply, governments share in investment risk through taxation on assets held in taxable accounts. Suppose asset returns are taxed entirely as ordinary income at the rate of t. If the standard deviation of pretax returns is \\uf073 and all investment losses provide tax deductions in the year they are incurred, then the standard deviation of after-tax returns is \\uf073(1 – t). That is, an investor bears only 1 – t of the pretax risk. Reichenstein (2007) provides an example, and others provide formal proofs (see, for example, Horan 2007a, 2007b; Horan and Al Zaman 2008). The government’s role in sharing risk and return has implications for asset allocation, asset location, and portfolio optimization. Jacob (1998, 1999) provides an early overview of the difference between traditional portfolio optimization and optimization for private wealth clients. Jacob is a pioneer of multiperiod, after-tax optimization as an alternative to classic mean–variance analysis. Her papers rely on a then-groundbreaking after- tax optimizer. Leibowitz (2003) shows how capital gains taxation can make the after-tax equity risk premium larger than the tax-free risk premium. Leibowitz and Bova (2009), for example, show that taxes change the reward- to-risk ratios and that the incentive to take risks may be greater for taxable investors. Reichenstein (2001, 2007), Wilcox, Horvitz, and diBartolomeo (2006), and Rogers (2006) apply these concepts to mean–variance optimiza- tion and show that optimal tax-adjusted asset allocations are substantially different from those derived in a tax- free environment. Horan (2007a) extends the approach to a broader set of taxable environments and predicates notions of tax-adjusted return on after-tax values rather than pretax values. In addition, Reichenstein (2001, 2006a, 2007), Horan (2005, 2007b), and Horan and Al Zaman (2008) suggest adjusting the pretax balances in tax-deferred accounts to after-tax dollars and calculating asset allocation based on the assets’ after-tax values. Each of the just-mentioned authors approaches the problem from a slightly different perspective. Horan and Al Zaman review the approaches, outline their relative merits, and extend the models by incorporating an asset’s cost basis. In general, however, the basic approach to tax-adjusted portfolio optimization involves adjusting expected returns, standard deviations, and (possibly) market values to reflect taxes. An important concept is that the same asset held in two different types of accounts essentially becomes two distinct after-tax assets (see Reichenstein 2001) because its after-tax expected return and after-tax standard deviation depend on the type of account in which it is held. For example, stocks and bonds held in taxable and tax-deferred accounts represent four different after-tax assets. More generally, n assets held in m account types may be effectively n × m distinct “assets” in an after-tax portfolio optimization. The variance–covariance matrix for n assets across m accounts, therefore, may grow to have n × m rows and n × m columns. Another important insight is that this type of tax-adjusted portfolio optimization solves the asset allocation and asset location problems simultaneously, which is discussed in the next section. In many jurisdictions, low-turnover equity strategies have return components that are taxed less heavily than ordinary income and are sometimes deferred. Therefore, stocks generally have less tax drag as an asset class than bonds that are taxed at higher rates with little opportunity for deferral. As a result, Horan and Al Zaman (2008) show that tax-adjusted portfolio optimization typically produces two results: • Taxable investors generally require a higher equity allocation than pretax investors to achieve the same risk exposure because taxes absorb some of the pretax risk. • Equity tends to be located in taxable accounts rather than tax-deferred accounts because equity returns are tax preferenced. See Dammon, Spatt, and Zhang (2004) and Shoven and Sialm (2004) for related studies.', '<2-hop>\\n\\nAsset Location and Ownership Structure.

Because they include Social Security and focus on retirement income replacement, they show that high-income individuals need much higher savings rates than low-income individuals.

Black, Ciccotello, and Skipper’s view of the family portfolio includes such assets as “government benefits, insurance, expected inheritances or other family support, and human capital” (p. 3). In addition, they include such liabilities as mortgages and future expenditures “including but not limited to tax, housing, education, and health care” (p. 3). Theirs is one of the broadest definitions of the extended portfolio in the literature. Wilcox, Horvitz, and diBartolomeo (2006) encourage private wealth managers to form a time series of implied balance sheets for each client. Assets and liabilities are assets and liabilities, both implied and actual. For example, the present value of future savings from employment is an implied employment asset, whereas the present value of spending in retirement is an implied liability. The ratio of discretionary wealth to total assets, where discretionary wealth is total assets less total liabilities, determines the client’s appropriate level of investment aggressiveness. Clients with large relative discretionary wealth can invest aggressively, whereas clients with no or little discretionary wealth to total assets should invest conservatively. Wilcox (2008) extends the analysis to incorporate the uncertain nature of investment goals resulting largely from longevity risk and shows that this uncertainty suggests a more conservative investment posture. Modern financial engineering offers the potential to better address client needs than traditional approaches have. Bodie (2003) contrasts life-cycle investing with single-period Markowitz optimization and describes how advances in financial engineering as well as developments in individual investor psychology can be used to help investors reach their goals. Like Bodie, Merton (2003) offers insights on life-cycle investing and sophisticated financial products. For individual investors, Merton advocates considering the risk of human capital, the risk of future reinvestments, volatility of spending versus volatility of wealth, the importance of targeted expenditures (i.e., liabilities), and “condo value insurance” (which hedges against residential real estate declining in value). Warshawsky (2007) discusses how investors can efficiently hedge risks associated with longevity and long-term health care by bundling a life annuity and long-term care insurance. His work is part of a larger body of readings on life-cycle investing edited by Bodie, McLeavey, and Siegel (2007) and another subsequent set of readings focused on retirement by Bodie, Siegel, and Sullivan (2009). Institutional pension management has long incorporated the idea of asset/liability management (ALM) or liability-driven investing (LDI). It is a truism that investors without liabilities do not need to invest; the point of the asset portfolio is to defer consumption to pay for future liabilities. Amenc, Martellini, Milhau, and Ziemann (2009) attempt to more practically operationalize the insights of institutional ALM and LDI in the private wealth management context. They emphasize that liability awareness requires consideration of the properties of assets that hedge those liabilities. For many individual investors, these liabilities include inflation-sensitive future consumption and the future purchase of real estate.
